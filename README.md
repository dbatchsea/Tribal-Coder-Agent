# Tribal Coder Agent

This system implements a local-first RAG pipeline using SQL Server (T-SQL Vector Search) and MCP-integrated agents to bridge the gap between legacy repo documentation and real-time institutional memory across Jira, Slack, and Teams. To maintain strict IP security and data privacy, the core orchestration logic and proprietary embedding strategies are housed in a private repository, while this space serves as the architectural blueprint and performance benchmark. Technical reviewers may request time-bound access to the private codebase to evaluate the DeepEval validation suites and the asynchronous MCP client implementation.

*Code is proprietary; available for review during technical interview upon request.*
